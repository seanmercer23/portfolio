                I am a detail-driven, energetic Software Engineer 
                who leverages my five-years of experience in video production
                to develop effective solutions that exceed clientâ€™s needs 
                in time-sensitive situations. </p>
                
                <p> As a developer, I take a solutions-driven approach 
                believing that any problem can be solved by breaking down 
                issues into smaller, manageable components. </p>
                
                <p> I crave opportunities to be part of a team that encourages 
                its members to learn from one-another 
                and grow both professionally and personally.</p>
